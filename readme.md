# Go Fuzzing Project

This project is focused on fuzzing TinyC and a subset of C, referred to as CLN, using Go. The fuzzing process leverages grammar-based techniques, probabilistic choice of rules, and a termination algorithm to effectively explore the input space.

## Introduction
This project aims to provide a robust fuzzing framework for TinyC and CLN using Go. The fuzzing process is designed to uncover bugs and vulnerabilities by generating diverse and unexpected inputs.
