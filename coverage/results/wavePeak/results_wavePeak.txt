OLD we changed code
Time:

We have tried to add 50 to wavePeak between each iteration
We can see the average time to compile goes up between each iteration,
however it is still pretty low (its in ms). However, it seems
that it takes a long time for clang to format it, and for gcc to compile
it. Up to multiple minutes at its peak.

Lines Executed:

- libtcc.c : no big difference between iterations
- tcc.c    : no big difference between iterations
- tccelf.c : no big difference between iterations
