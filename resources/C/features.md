Values:
- [ ] Strings (with basic operations like concatenation and length checks)
- [ ] Ints (signed and unsigned)
- [ ] Chars (useful for lightweight string fuzzing)
- [ ] Floats (basic arithmetic, though fuzzing them adds complexity)

Variables:
- [ ] Global Variables
- [ ] Local Variables
- [ ] Scoped Shadowing (e.g., re-declaring a variable in a narrower scope)
- [ ] Constants (const keyword)

General Constructs:
- [ ] Comparison (==, !=, <=, >=, <, >)
- [ ] Arithmetic (+, -, /, *, %)
- [ ] Logical (&&, ||, !)
- [ ] Bitwise (&, |, ^, ~)
- [ ] Shifting (<<, >>)
- [ ] Increment/Decrement (++, --)

- [ ] if
- [ ] if-else
- [ ] switch (minimal, with a default case)
- [ ] Loops (while, do-while, for)
- [ ] break and continue

Functions
- [ ] Function Declarations
- [ ] Function Calls
- [ ] Recursive Functions (optional for added complexity)

Memory and Pointers
- [ ] Pointers (basic dereferencing, * and &)
- [ ] Arrays (1D only for simplicity)
- [ ] malloc and free (manual memory management)
- [ ] sizeof operator

I/O
- [ ] Basic printf for debugging output
- [ ] File I/O (optional, e.g., reading/writing small files)
